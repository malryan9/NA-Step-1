        <h2 class="Title__Question">What does "the disease of addiction" mean to me?</h2>
        <p class="Answer">
            The disease of addiction to me is a demon.
            A terrible reaping of what i sowed out of curiosity.
            Nobody in my family that I know of struggled from addiction.
            So i dont think it was hereditery for me. I was just too curius.
        </p>
        <h2 class="Title__Question">Has my disease been active recently? In what way?</h2>
        <p class="Answer">
            It's been a little over 100 days as im writing this since ive put crystal meth or alcohol into my body.
        </p>
        <h2 class="Title__Question">What is it like when I'm obsessed with something? Does my thinking follow a pattern?
            Describe.</h2>
        <p class="Answer">
            I guess my thinking does follow a pattern. Perhaps I get "focused" & "obsessed" mixed up.
            I like to say im "Hyper-focused" on certain tasks in my life. I get in the zone. But maybe it is more of an obssession. 
            Like right now i feel as if i have to devote all my free time to my schoolwork.
            Just the thought of going off path or taking a break gets me aggitated or sad.
        </p>
        <h2 class="Title__Question">When a thought occurs to me, do I immediately act on it without considering the
            consequences? In what other ways do I behave compulsively?</h2>
        <p class="Answer">
            I have done this alot in the past but not as much recently. 
            Lately ive been better at this ... or so I believe
        </p>
        <h2 class="Title__Question">How does the self-centered part of my disease affect my life and the lives of those around
            me?</h2>
        <p class="Answer">
            I don't know. It's usually only ex girlfriends who call me "self-centered". 
            But I see it as something else. Maybe i'm in denial. Who knows.
        </p>
        <h2 class="Title__Question">How has my disease affected me physically? Mentally? Spiritually? Emotionally?</h2>
        <p class="Answer">
            I get sharp pains in my lower stomach randomly. I have frequent uncontrollable burping.
            The paranoia from using never went away. My heart stutters and hurrts sometimes now.
            I watched my ex-wife lose her mind which broke my heart.
            I have to remind myself of all these consiquences ive already experienced from this drug.
        </p>
        <h2 class="Title__Question">What is the specific way in which my addiction has been manifesting itself most
            recently?</h2>
            <p class="Answer">
               I dream of using from time to time but my common sense knows better...
            </p>
        <h2 class="Title__Question">Have I been obsessed with a person, place, or thing? If so, how has that gotten in the way
            of my relationships with others? How else have I been affected mentally, physically,
            spiritually, and emotionally by this obsession?</h2>
        <p class="Answer">
           Obsessed with music, which i am currently fasting from. Obsessed with my wife who i am now divorced from.
           Obsessed with meth which messed my head up more than it already was. Currently obsessed with schoolwork which is a good thing in my opinion.
        </p>
        <h2 class="Title__Question">Have I given plausible but untrue reasons for my behavior? What have they been?</h2>
        <p class="Answer">
          I strive to be truthfull as often as I can. So I would say no.
        </p>
        <h2 class="Title__Question">Have I compulsively acted on an obsession, and then acted as if I had actually planned to
            act that way? When were those times?</h2>
        <p class="Answer">
            I dont think so.
        </p>
        <h2 class="Title__Question">How have I blamed other people for my behavior?</h2>
        <p class="Answer">
            Yes. My parents for treating me like a black sheep and not believeing in my dreams. 
            And my ex-wife for introducing the drugs to me.
        </p>
        <h2 class="Title__Question">How have I compared my addiction with others' addiction? Is my addiction "bad enough"
            if I don't compare it to anyone else's?</h2>
        <p class="Answer">
            I compare my addiction by saying "I did'nt start using till i was 26".
            Or "I only used on and off for 2 years". Or "I can use but & not go out of control with it... im not an addict".
        </p>
        <h2 class="Title__Question">Am I comparing a current manifestation of my addiction to the way my life was before I
            got clean? Am I plagued by the idea that I should know better?</h2>
        <p class="Answer">
            I dont think so.
        </p>
        <h2 class="Title__Question">Have I been thinking that I have enough information about addiction and recovery to get

        </p>
        <h2 class="Title__Question">Am I avoiding action because I'm afraid I will be ashamed when I face the results of my

        </p>
        <h2 class="Title__Question">What situation led me to formally work Step One?</h2>
