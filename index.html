        <h2 class="Title__Question">What does "the disease of addiction" mean to me?</h2>
        <p class="Answer">
            The disease of addiction to me is a demon.
            A terrible reaping of what i sowed out of curiosity.
            Never thought I'd ever love a drug as "hardcore" as methamphetamine.
            Starting at 16 I drank on and off for a decade & i never considered myself addicted. 
            I had it all under control. I could stop anytime I wanted.
            Then I tried meth. It made me better at everything I did.
            Still I didn't want to label myself as an addict.
            Three years later and I crave the drug daily. 
            Planning my next relapse in my head. 
            How, when & why ill use again.
            I must not follow through with any of it.
            I get sharp pains in my lower stomach randomly. 
            I have frequent uncontrollable burping.
            The paranoia from using never went away.
            I have to remind myself of all these consiquences 
            so that I wont follow through on getting high again.

            Our addiction can manifest itself in a variety of ways. When we first come to Narcotics
