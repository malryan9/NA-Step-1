        <h2 class="Title__Question">What does "the disease of addiction" mean to me?</h2>
        <p class="Answer">
            The disease of addiction to me is a demon.
            A terrible reaping of what i sowed out of curiosity.
            Never thought I'd ever love a drug as "hardcore" as methamphetamine.
            Starting at 16 I drank on and off for a decade & i never considered myself addicted. 
            I had it all under control. I could stop anytime I wanted.
            Then I tried meth. It made me better at everything I did.
            Still I didn't want to label myself as an addict.
            Three years later and I crave the drug daily. 
            Planning my next relapse in my head. 
            How, when & why ill use again.
            I must not follow through with any of it.
            I get sharp pains in my lower stomach randomly. 
            I have frequent uncontrollable burping.
            The paranoia from using never went away.
            I have to remind myself of all these consiquences 
            so that I wont follow through on getting high again.

            Our addiction can manifest itself in a variety of ways. When we first come to Narcotics
            Anonymous, our problem will, of course, be drugs. Later on, we may find out that
            addiction is wreaking havoc in our lives in any number of ways.
